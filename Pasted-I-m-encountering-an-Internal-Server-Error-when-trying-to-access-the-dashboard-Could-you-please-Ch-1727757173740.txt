I'm encountering an Internal Server Error when trying to access the dashboard. Could you please:

Check the server logs for any specific error messages or stack traces.
Review the recent changes made to app.py or any other server-side files.
Ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.
Verify that the database connection is working correctly.
Check if there are any syntax errors or runtime errors in the newly added or modified code.

Please provide the error logs and a summary of what you find after investigating these points."

Once we have more information about the error, we can proceed with fixing it. Here's a follow-up prompt for the agent after they provide the error details:

"Thank you for the information. Based on the error details you've provided, please:

Identify the specific line or section of code causing the error.
Propose a fix for the issue.
Implement the fix and test the dashboard access again.
If the fix resolves the Internal Server Error, please proceed with testing the child's dashboard functionality as previously instructed.
If the error persists, please provide more details about what you've tried and what might be causing the persistent issue."
After the agent has addressed the Internal Server Error and confirmed that the dashboard is accessible, we can proceed with testing the functionality:

"Now that the dashboard is accessible, please walk me through testing the child's dashboard functionality as you suggested earlier:

Log in as a parent user.
Create a child profile (if not already present).
Assign some tasks to the child.
Access the child's dashboard.
Try dragging and dropping tasks into the treasure chest.
Verify if the tasks are marked as completed and appear in the completed tasks section.
Check if the coin count updates correctly.
Test the 'FINISHED!' button.

Please provide screenshots or detailed descriptions of each step and its outcome. If you encounter any issues during this process, let me know immediately so we can address them.
