Thank you for your continued efforts on this project. While the app is working flawlessly on desktop (iMac), we're still encountering issues when accessing it from an iPad. This is a critical problem as iPads are likely to be a primary device for our target users. Please focus on resolving these cross-platform compatibility issues:

1. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure all CSS is using responsive units (e.g., %, vh/vw, rem) instead of fixed pixel values.
   - Implement media queries to adjust layouts for tablet screen sizes.
   - Test flexbox or grid layouts to ensure proper element alignment on different screen sizes.

2. Touch Interactions:
   - Replace any hover-based interactions with touch-friendly alternatives.
   - Ensure all clickable elements have appropriate touch target sizes (at least 44x44 pixels).
   - Implement touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) alongside mouse events.

3. Drag and Drop Functionality:
   - Test and optimize the drag-and-drop library for touch devices.
   - Consider using a mobile-friendly library like interact.js or Hammer.js for gesture recognition.

4. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test the app on Safari for iOS, as it's the default browser on iPads.
   - Ensure all JavaScript is compatible with the iOS version of Safari.

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Minimize DOM manipulations and optimize JavaScript for mobile devices.
   - Compress and optimize images and other assets for faster loading on mobile networks.

6. Viewport Settings:
   - Verify that the viewport meta tag is correctly set for mobile devices.

7. Form Inputs:
   - Ensure form inputs are touch-friendly and trigger the appropriate keyboard types on iOS.

8. Debugging:
   - Use remote debugging tools (like Safari Web Inspector for iOS) to identify specific issues on the iPad.

9. Progressive Enhancement:
   - Implement core functionality using basic HTML and CSS, then enhance with JavaScript to ensure basic usability even if scripts fail to load.

10. Testing:
    - Perform thorough testing on multiple iPad models and iOS versions if possible.
    - Use browser developer tools to simulate iPad devices for initial testing.

Please provide:
1. A list of specific issues encountered on the iPad and how you've addressed each one.
2. Updated code snippets showing the changes made for iPad compatibility.
3. Screenshots of the app running successfully on an iPad or iPad simulator.
4. A testing protocol that can be followed to verify iPad compatibility for all app functions.

After making these changes, please provide step-by-step instructions for testing the app on an iPad, including how to access it (e.g., specific URL or deployment instructions) and any known limitations or differences in functionality compared to the desktop version.
