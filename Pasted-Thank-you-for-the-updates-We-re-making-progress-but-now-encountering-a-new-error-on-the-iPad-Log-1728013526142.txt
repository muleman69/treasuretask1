Thank you for the updates. We're making progress, but now encountering a new error on the iPad: 'Login successful, but session not established. Please try again.' This suggests an issue with session management. Please investigate and resolve the following:

Session Configuration:

Review the session configuration in app.py. Ensure that session settings are correctly defined.
Check if you're using Flask-Session or similar extensions, and verify their configuration.


Cookie Settings:

Examine the cookie settings for the session. Ensure that the SameSite attribute is set to 'None' and the Secure flag is set to True.
Verify that the cookie domain is correctly set to match the app's domain.


CORS Configuration:

Double-check CORS settings to ensure they allow credentials.
If using Flask-CORS, make sure it's configured with supports_credentials=True.


Client-Side Storage:

In login.js, after a successful login, attempt to store a small piece of data in localStorage and retrieve it to verify client-side storage is working.


HTTPS:

Confirm that the app is being served over HTTPS, as this is crucial for secure cookie transmission.


Error Handling:

Implement more detailed error logging on both client and server sides.
In login.js, add console.log statements to track the login process and any received responses.


Session Creation:

In the login route of app.py, add explicit logging to show when a session is created and what data is stored in it.


Response Headers:

Check the response headers of the login request to ensure the Set-Cookie header is present and correctly formatted.



Please provide:

Updated app.py code, focusing on session management and login route.
Updated login.js code with added error logging.
Server logs showing the login attempt and session creation process.
Client-side console logs from a login attempt on the iPad.
Response headers from a login request on the iPad.

After making these changes, please provide step-by-step instructions for testing on the iPad, including how to access browser console logs for debugging.
